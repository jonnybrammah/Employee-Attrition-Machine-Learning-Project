# Employee-Attrition-Machine-Learning-Project

## Team Introduction 
Team Members: Jonny Brammah, Brennan Copp, Francis Crawford, Agustin Estupinan, Isabelle Roetcisoender 

## Project Overview 
This project was all about attrition! In the wake of the great resignation, we wanted to investigate why people leave their jobs, what the most statistically significant reasons are, compared to what people say, and finally create a Machine Learning Model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave or stay.

To answer these questions, we used information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job and company reviews from Glassdoor, and an HR Attrition Dataset provided by IBM.
This dataset included factors, including:
- Employee personal information (age, gender, marital status, etc.)
- Information about their jobs (department, role, years with current manager etc.)
- Compensation information (salary, recent increases, stock option, etc.)
- Employee reviews on work-life balance and culture.

Average training does have a slight influence on attrition. 
The more training an employee receives, the less likely they are to be terminated or resign. 

For employees with greater work-life balance, they are less likely to be terminated or resign. 
For employees with less work-life balance, they are more likely to be terminated or resign.

The greater the average environment satisfaction and average job satisfaction, the less likely an employee is to be terminated or resign. 
The less the average environment satisfaction and average job satisfaction, the less likely an employee is to be terminated or resign. 

Similarly, the higher the monthly income (avg ~$7k) the less likely an employee is to resign or be terminated. 
For employees with lower monthly income (avg ~$5k) the more likely an employee is to be terminated or resign.
