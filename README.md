# Employee-Attrition-Machine-Learning-Project

## Team Introduction 
Team Members: Jonny Brammah, Brennan Copp, Francis Crawford, Augustin Estupinan, Isabelle Roetcisoender 

## Project Overview 
Our project focus is to create a machine-learning model that predicts employee attrition based on a number of factors such as age, ethnicity, gender, job satisfaction, salary, hours per week, and work-life balance. 

May 2021 was dubbed, "The Great Resignation". Our group is interested in understanding the underlying causes of U.S. workers who chose to resign from their jobs.
